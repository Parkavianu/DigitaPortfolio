            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>Rani Lakshmi Bai, the Queen of Jhansi, was a fearless warrior and a key figure in the Indian Rebellion of 1857. She was born on November 19, 1828, and her bravery and determination have left an indelible mark in the pages of Indian history.</p>
            <h2>Legacy</h2>
            <p>Jhansi Rani's legacy lives on as a symbol of resistance against colonial rule. She fought valiantly for the freedom of her people and continues to inspire generations of Indians to stand up for their rights.</p>
       <h2>History of Jhansi, 1842 – May 1857</h2>
       <p> Manikarnika was married to the Maharaja of Jhansi, Gangadhar Rao Newalkar, in May 1842[3][18] and was afterward called Lakshmibai (or Laxmibai) in honor of the Hindu goddess Devi Lakshmi and according to the Maharashtrian tradition of women being given a new name after marriage. In September 1851, she gave birth to a boy, later named Damodar Rao, who died four months after birth due to a chronic illness. The Maharaja adopted a child called Anand Rao, the son of Gangadhar Rao's cousin, who was renamed Damodar Rao, on the day before the Maharaja died.[19] The adoption was in the presence of the British political officer who was given a letter from the Maharaja instructing that the child be treated with respect and that the government of Jhansi should be given to his widow for her lifetime.

        After the death of the Maharaja in November 1853, because Damodar Rao (born Anand Rao) was an adopted son, the British East India Company, under Governor-General Lord Dalhousie, applied the Doctrine of Lapse, rejecting Damodar Rao's claim to the throne and annexing the state to its territories. When she was informed of this she cried out "Main apni Jhansi nahi doongi" (I shall not surrender my Jhansi). In March 1854, Rani Lakshmibai was given an annual pension of Rs. 60,000 and ordered to leave the palace and the fort.[20][21]
        
        According to Vishnu Bhatt Godse, the Rani would exercise at weightlifting, wrestling, and steeplechasing before breakfast. An intelligent and simply-dressed woman, she ruled in a businesslike manner.</p>
